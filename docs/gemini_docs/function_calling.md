Function calling with the Gemini API

Function calling lets you connect models to external tools and APIs. Instead of generating text responses, the model determines when to call specific functions and provides the necessary parameters to execute real-world actions. This allows the model to act as a bridge between natural language and real-world actions and data. Function calling has 3 primary use cases:

    Augment Knowledge: Access information from external sources like databases, APIs, and knowledge bases.
    Extend Capabilities: Use external tools to perform computations and extend the limitations of the model, such as using a calculator or creating charts.
    Take Actions: Interact with external systems using APIs, such as scheduling appointments, creating invoices, sending emails, or controlling smart home devices.


## Schedule a meeting:

```ts
import { GoogleGenAI, Type } from '@google/genai';

// Configure the client
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

// Define the function declaration for the model
const scheduleMeetingFunctionDeclaration = {
  name: 'schedule_meeting',
  description: 'Schedules a meeting with specified attendees at a given time and date.',
  parameters: {
    type: Type.OBJECT,
    properties: {
      attendees: {
        type: Type.ARRAY,
        items: { type: Type.STRING },
        description: 'List of people attending the meeting.',
      },
      date: {
        type: Type.STRING,
        description: 'Date of the meeting (e.g., "2024-07-29")',
      },
      time: {
        type: Type.STRING,
        description: 'Time of the meeting (e.g., "15:00")',
      },
      topic: {
        type: Type.STRING,
        description: 'The subject or topic of the meeting.',
      },
    },
    required: ['attendees', 'date', 'time', 'topic'],
  },
};

// Send request with function declarations
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  contents: 'Schedule a meeting with Bob and Alice for 03/27/2025 at 10:00 AM about the Q3 planning.',
  config: {
    tools: [{
      functionDeclarations: [scheduleMeetingFunctionDeclaration]
    }],
  },
});

// Check for function calls in the response
if (response.functionCalls && response.functionCalls.length > 0) {
  const functionCall = response.functionCalls[0]; // Assuming one function call
  console.log(`Function to call: ${functionCall.name}`);
  console.log(`Arguments: ${JSON.stringify(functionCall.args)}`);
  // In a real app, you would call your actual function here:
  // const result = await scheduleMeeting(functionCall.args);
} else {
  console.log("No function call found in the response.");
  console.log(response.text);
}

```

## Create Chart

```ts
import { GoogleGenAI, Type } from '@google/genai';

// Configure the client
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

// Define the function declaration for the model
const createChartFunctionDeclaration = {
  name: 'create_bar_chart',
  description: 'Creates a bar chart given a title, labels, and corresponding values.',
  parameters: {
    type: Type.OBJECT,
    properties: {
      title: {
        type: Type.STRING,
        description: 'The title for the chart.',
      },
      labels: {
        type: Type.ARRAY,
        items: { type: Type.STRING },
        description: 'List of labels for the data points (e.g., ["Q1", "Q2", "Q3"]).',
      },
      values: {
        type: Type.ARRAY,
        items: { type: Type.NUMBER },
        description: 'List of numerical values corresponding to the labels (e.g., [50000, 75000, 60000]).',
      },
    },
    required: ['title', 'labels', 'values'],
  },
};

// Send request with function declarations
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  contents: "Create a bar chart titled 'Quarterly Sales' with data: Q1: 50000, Q2: 75000, Q3: 60000.",
  config: {
    tools: [{
      functionDeclarations: [createChartFunctionDeclaration]
    }],
  },
});

// Check for function calls in the response
if (response.functionCalls && response.functionCalls.length > 0) {
  const functionCall = response.functionCalls[0]; // Assuming one function call
  console.log(`Function to call: ${functionCall.name}`);
  console.log(`Arguments: ${JSON.stringify(functionCall.args)}`);
  // In a real app, you would call your actual function here:
  // const result = await createBarChart(functionCall.args);
} else {
  console.log("No function call found in the response.");
  console.log(response.text);
}

```

Function calling involves a structured interaction between your application, the model, and external functions. Here's a breakdown of the process:

    Define Function Declaration: Define the function declaration in your application code. Function Declarations describe the function's name, parameters, and purpose to the model.
    Call LLM with function declarations: Send user prompt along with the function declaration(s) to the model. It analyzes the request and determines if a function call would be helpful. If so, it responds with a structured JSON object.
    Execute Function Code (Your Responsibility): The Model does not execute the function itself. It's your application's responsibility to process the response and check for Function Call, if
        Yes: Extract the name and args of the function and execute the corresponding function in your application.
        No: The model has provided a direct text response to the prompt (this flow is less emphasized in the example but is a possible outcome).
    Create User friendly response: If a function was executed, capture the result and send it back to the model in a subsequent turn of the conversation. It will use the result to generate a final, user-friendly response that incorporates the information from the function call.

This process can be repeated over multiple turns, allowing for complex interactions and workflows. The model also supports calling multiple functions in a single turn (parallel function calling) and in sequence (compositional function calling).
Step 1: Define a function declaration
Define a function and its declaration within your application code that allows users to set light values and make an API request. This function could call external services or APIs.

```ts
import { Type } from '@google/genai';

// Define a function that the model can call to control smart lights
const setLightValuesFunctionDeclaration = {
  name: 'set_light_values',
  description: 'Sets the brightness and color temperature of a light.',
  parameters: {
    type: Type.OBJECT,
    properties: {
      brightness: {
        type: Type.NUMBER,
        description: 'Light level from 0 to 100. Zero is off and 100 is full brightness',
      },
      color_temp: {
        type: Type.STRING,
        enum: ['daylight', 'cool', 'warm'],
        description: 'Color temperature of the light fixture, which can be `daylight`, `cool` or `warm`.',
      },
    },
    required: ['brightness', 'color_temp'],
  },
};

/**

*   Set the brightness and color temperature of a room light. (mock API)
*   @param {number} brightness - Light level from 0 to 100. Zero is off and 100 is full brightness
*   @param {string} color_temp - Color temperature of the light fixture, which can be `daylight`, `cool` or `warm`.
*   @return {Object} A dictionary containing the set brightness and color temperature.
*/
function setLightValues(brightness, color_temp) {
  return {
    brightness: brightness,
    colorTemperature: color_temp
  };
}

```


Step 2: Call the model with function declarations
Once you have defined your function declarations, you can prompt the model to use them. It analyzes the prompt and function declarations and decides whether to respond directly or to call a function. If a function is called, the response object will contain a function call suggestion.

```ts
import { GoogleGenAI } from '@google/genai';

// Generation config with function declaration
const config = {
  tools: [{
    functionDeclarations: [setLightValuesFunctionDeclaration]
  }]
};

// Configure the client
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

// Define user prompt
const contents = [
  {
    role: 'user',
    parts: [{ text: 'Turn the lights down to a romantic level' }]
  }
];

// Send request with function declarations
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  contents: contents,
  config: config
});

console.log(response.functionCalls[0]);

```

The model then returns a functionCall object in an OpenAPI compatible schema specifying how to call one or more of the declared functions in order to respond to the user's question.

```ts
{
  name: 'set_light_values',
  args: { brightness: 25, color_temp: 'warm' }
}
```


Step 3: Execute set_light_values function code
Extract the function call details from the model's response, parse the arguments , and execute the set_light_values function.


```ts
// Extract tool call details
const tool_call = response.functionCalls[0]

let result;
if (tool_call.name === 'set_light_values') {
  result = setLightValues(tool_call.args.brightness, tool_call.args.color_temp);
  console.log(`Function execution result: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`);
}

```

Step 4: Create user friendly response with function result and call the model again
Finally, send the result of the function execution back to the model so it can incorporate this information into its final response to the user.

```ts
// Create a function response part
const function_response_part = {
  name: tool_call.name,
  response: { result }
}

// Append function call and result of the function execution to contents
contents.push(response.candidates[0].content);
contents.push({ role: 'user', parts: [{ functionResponse: function_response_part }] });

// Get the final response from the model
const final_response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  contents: contents,
  config: config
});

console.log(final_response.text);

```

This completes the function calling flow. The model successfully used the set_light_values function to perform the request action of the user.
Function declarations

When you implement function calling in a prompt, you create a tools object, which contains one or more function declarations. You define functions using JSON, specifically with a select subset of the OpenAPI schema format. A single function declaration can include the following parameters:

    name (string): A unique name for the function (get_weather_forecast, send_email). Use descriptive names without spaces or special characters (use underscores or camelCase).
    description (string): A clear and detailed explanation of the function's purpose and capabilities. This is crucial for the model to understand when to use the function. Be specific and provide examples if helpful ("Finds theaters based on location and optionally movie title which is currently playing in theaters.").
    parameters (object): Defines the input parameters the function expects.
        type (string): Specifies the overall data type, such as object.
        properties (object): Lists individual parameters, each with:
            type (string): The data type of the parameter, such as string, integer, boolean, array.
            description (string): A description of the parameter's purpose and format. Provide examples and constraints ("The city and state, e.g., 'San Francisco, CA' or a zip code e.g., '95616'.").
            enum (array, optional): If the parameter values are from a fixed set, use "enum" to list the allowed values instead of just describing them in the description. This improves accuracy ("enum": ["daylight", "cool", "warm"]).
        required (array): An array of strings listing the parameter names that are mandatory for the function to operate.

You can also construct FunctionDeclarations from Python functions directly using types.FunctionDeclaration.from_callable(client=client, callable=your_function).
Function calling with thinking

Enabling "thinking" can improve function call performance by allowing the model to reason through a request before suggesting function calls. The Gemini API is stateless, the model's reasoning context will be lost between turns in a multi-turn conversation. To preserve this context, you can use thought signatures. A thought signature is an encrypted representation of the model's internal thought process that you pass back to the model on subsequent turns.

The standard pattern for multi-turn tool use is to append the model's complete previous response to the conversation history. The content object includes the thought_signatures automatically. If you follow this pattern No code changes are required.
Manually managing thought signatures

If you modify the conversation history manually—instead of sending the complete previous response and want to benefit from thinking you must correctly handle the thought_signature included in the model's turn.

Follow these rules to ensure the model's context is preserved:

    Always send the thought_signature back to the model inside its original Part.
    Don't merge a Part containing a signature with one that does not. This breaks the positional context of the thought.
    Don't combine two Parts that both contain signatures, as the signature strings cannot be merged.

Inspecting Thought Signatures
While not necessary for implementation, you can inspect the response to see the thought_signature for debugging or educational purposes.


```ts
// After receiving a response from a model with thinking enabled
// const response = await ai.models.generateContent(...)

// The signature is attached to the response part containing the function call
const part = response.candidates[0].content.parts[0];
if (part.thoughtSignature) {
  console.log(part.thoughtSignature);
}

```

## Parallel function calling
In addition to single turn function calling, you can also call multiple functions at once. Parallel function calling lets you execute multiple functions at once and is used when the functions are not dependent on each other. This is useful in scenarios like gathering data from multiple independent sources, such as retrieving customer details from different databases or checking inventory levels across various warehouses or performing multiple actions such as converting your apartment into a disco.

```ts
import { Type } from '@google/genai';

const powerDiscoBall = {
  name: 'power_disco_ball',
  description: 'Powers the spinning disco ball.',
  parameters: {
    type: Type.OBJECT,
    properties: {
      power: {
        type: Type.BOOLEAN,
        description: 'Whether to turn the disco ball on or off.'
      }
    },
    required: ['power']
  }
};

const startMusic = {
  name: 'start_music',
  description: 'Play some music matching the specified parameters.',
  parameters: {
    type: Type.OBJECT,
    properties: {
      energetic: {
        type: Type.BOOLEAN,
        description: 'Whether the music is energetic or not.'
      },
      loud: {
        type: Type.BOOLEAN,
        description: 'Whether the music is loud or not.'
      }
    },
    required: ['energetic', 'loud']
  }
};

const dimLights = {
  name: 'dim_lights',
  description: 'Dim the lights.',
  parameters: {
    type: Type.OBJECT,
    properties: {
      brightness: {
        type: Type.NUMBER,
        description: 'The brightness of the lights, 0.0 is off, 1.0 is full.'
      }
    },
    required: ['brightness']
  }
};

```
Configure the function calling mode to allow using all of the specified tools. To learn more, you can read about configuring function calling.

```ts

import { GoogleGenAI } from '@google/genai';

// Set up function declarations
const houseFns = [powerDiscoBall, startMusic, dimLights];

const config = {
    tools: [{
        functionDeclarations: houseFns
    }],
    // Force the model to call 'any' function, instead of chatting.
    toolConfig: {
        functionCallingConfig: {
            mode: 'any'
        }
    }
};

// Configure the client
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

// Create a chat session
const chat = ai.chats.create({
    model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
    config: config
});
const response = await chat.sendMessage({message: 'Turn this place into a party!'});

// Print out each of the function calls requested from this single call
console.log("Example 1: Forced function calling");
for (const fn of response.functionCalls) {
    const args = Object.entries(fn.args)
        .map(([key, val]) => `${key}=${val}`)
        .join(', ');
    console.log(`${fn.name}(${args})`);
}

```

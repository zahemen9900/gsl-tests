Text generation

The Gemini API can generate text output from various inputs, including text, images, video, and audio, leveraging Gemini models.

Here's a basic example that takes a single text input:

```ts
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "How does AI work?",
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();
```


Thinking with Gemini 2.5

2.5 Flash and Pro models have "thinking" enabled by default to enhance quality, which may take longer to run and increase token usage.

When using 2.5 Flash, you can disable thinking by setting the thinking budget to zero.

For more details, see the thinking guide.


```ts

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "How does AI work?",
    config: {
      thinkingConfig: {
        thinkingBudget: 0, // Disables thinking
      },
    }
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();

```
System instructions and other configurations
You can guide the behavior of Gemini models with system instructions. To do so, pass a GenerateContentConfig object.


```ts
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "Hello there",
    config: {
      systemInstruction: "You are a cat. Your name is Neko.",
    },
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();
```
The GenerateContentConfig object also lets you override default generation parameters, such as temperature.


```ts
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "Explain how AI works",
    config: {
      temperature: 0.1,
    },
  });
  console.log(response.text);
}

await main();

```

Streaming responses

By default, the model returns a response only after the entire generation process is complete.

For more fluid interactions, use streaming to receive GenerateContentResponse instances incrementally as they're generated.

```ts
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContentStream({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    contents: "Explain how AI works",
  });

  for await (const chunk of response) {
    console.log(chunk.text);
  }
}

await main();

```


Multi-turn conversations (chat)
Our SDKs provide functionality to collect multiple rounds of prompts and responses into a chat, giving you an easy way to keep track of the conversation history.

```ts

import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const chat = ai.chats.create({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    history: [
      {
        role: "user",
        parts: [{ text: "Hello" }],
      },
      {
        role: "model",
        parts: [{ text: "Great to meet you. What would you like to know?" }],
      },
    ],
  });

  const response1 = await chat.sendMessage({
    message: "I have 2 dogs in my house.",
  });
  console.log("Chat response 1:", response1.text);

  const response2 = await chat.sendMessage({
    message: "How many paws are in my house?",
  });
  console.log("Chat response 2:", response2.text);
}

await main();

```

Streaming can also be used for multi-turn conversations.

```ts
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({});

async function main() {
  const chat = ai.chats.create({
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash",
    history: [
      {
        role: "user",
        parts: [{ text: "Hello" }],
      },
      {
        role: "model",
        parts: [{ text: "Great to meet you. What would you like to know?" }],
      },
    ],
  });

  const stream1 = await chat.sendMessageStream({
    message: "I have 2 dogs in my house.",
  });
  for await (const chunk of stream1) {
    console.log(chunk.text);
    console.log("_".repeat(80));
  }

  const stream2 = await chat.sendMessageStream({
    message: "How many paws are in my house?",
  });
  for await (const chunk of stream2) {
    console.log(chunk.text);
    console.log("_".repeat(80));
  }
}

await main();

Supported models

All models in the Gemini family support text generation. To learn more about the models and their capabilities, visit the Models page.
Best practices
Prompting tips

For basic text generation, a zero-shot prompt often suffices without needing examples, system instructions or specific formatting.

For more tailored outputs:

    Use System instructions to guide the model.
    Provide few example inputs and outputs to guide the model. This is often referred to as few-shot prompting.

Consult our prompt engineering guide for more tips.
Structured output

In some cases, you may need structured output, such as JSON. Refer to our structured output guide to learn how.
